    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, Charter Schools that have smaller class sizes and less funding produce better test results than District Schools with more students and higher budgets. Spending more money per student does not appear to have a positive impact on improving test scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Charter schools appear to be better able to achieve higher test scores with less money to spend per student. The top 5 schools are all charter schools and they are all able to maintain Math and Reading scores at an average of 83 points across all grades, with a great passing rate of 90.43% overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "- District schools have much larger class sizes, above 2,000 students, as well as a higher budget per student, but that does not translate into higher test scores. More students are struggling with math than with reading but, overall, only 53.67% of District School students were able to pass both math and reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "- While itâ€™s clear that Charter schools out perform District schools, it is not readily apparent as to why that is. From our available data, we can infer that class size might be an important factor, but it might be beneficial to expand our analysis to look into the in-school resources made available to students (such as tutoring and library services) as well as an overview of the teachers (eg: skill level, years teaching, salaries, job satisfaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It would also be helpful to do an additional analysis to look at the demographics of the schools and the students. The needs of the individual schools will vary depending on the individual students that make up the student body. A quick snapshot of these particulars might give us a better understanding of why certain schools might be failing or succeeding. These reports, as well as a breakdown of exactly what each school spends its budget on,  would be very useful in helping us achieve our goal of making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
