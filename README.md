# Pandas_Challenge

It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.


1. I looked up the .nunique() function that I used in the very first box. 
2.  With the amount of starter code included in the challenge files, it was very easy to go back to previous code from both the challenge and the module 4 activities to figure out the correct answers. 
3. I don't really remember what else I looked up online. I've started to get very comfortable with immediately looking things up online and finding which sites are easiet for me to understand. I did run into a number of errors while working on this challenge, but I was able to overcome them using Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, SparkByExamples, W3Schools, Datacamp, RealPython.com, and PyData.org.
